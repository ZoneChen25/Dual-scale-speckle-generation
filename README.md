# Dual-scale-speckle-generation
Two methods for the generation of dual-scale Turing speckles for DIC:<br>
1. "fftspecklegen.m" denotes the method for generating dual-scale speckles in frequency domain.<br>
2. "Jincspecklegen.m" denotes the method for generating dual-scale speckles with a designed kernel.
